This project was created as a submission for the Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone Competition which was part of the 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google.

# Personalized-AI-Career-Coach-for-Students

Our objective was to build an intelligent, multi-modal assistant that helps students explore career paths, based on their background, skills, and interests by analyzing their documents (resumes, transcripts, personal statements) and suggesting personalized options. It also retrieves real-world data like job roles, required skills, certifications, and career success stories to support students' decisions.

We chose to implement this project because 
- This combines multiple GenAI capabilities in a cohesive and useful way.
- Solves a genuine problem that affects millions of students worldwide.
- Highly customizable and extendable (can adapt for job seekers, career switchers, etc.).
- Promotes equity by giving under-resourced students access to smart guidance.
